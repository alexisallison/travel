            <h2>Why the Maldives?</h2>
            <h3>The World's Leading Destination 2020-2022</h3>
            <p>
              The Maldives is one of the dreamiest travel destinations that
              offer spellbinding sceneries, warm temperatures, the fresh breeze
              of the seas, beautiful coral reefs and secluded stays. The
              Maldives provides idyllic locations with powdery white sands, blue
              lagoons and turquoise oceans.
            </p>
            <p>
              A common trend when visiting the Maldives is that it feels like
              time slows down here. Not only do travelers have the luxury to
              partake in activities at their own pace but if they choose not to,
              then they could simply spend an entire day lounging by the
              oceanside.

                  is very clean, our villa was spacious and very comfortable.
                  The food was delicious and had variety. And most of all, the
                  staff is what makes this resort outstanding! Everyone was
                  gracious, friendly & always ready to help with a smile and
                  helping hand. Special shout out to Hanane, she was great in
                  assisting us with anything that we need. We will definitely be
                  back again in the near future!"
